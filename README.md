# RMarkdown CV 

Builds a .pdf CV using R Markdown and LaTex. Relatively easy to edit text if you know some Markdown and formatting if you know some LaTeX. My CV example posted here is up to date as of 05/04/2023. 

# To use

1. Fork this repository. 
2. Install R and R Studio. 
3. Open resume.Rproj in R Studio.
4. Customize klein_cv.Rmd to edit text (can rename file also). (Optional) edit cv-latex.tex to edit formatting.
5. Click "knit" button in R Studio to output .pdf file.

Based on templates by [isteves](https://github.com/isteves/resume), [svmiller](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates), and [ryanpeek](https://github.com/ryanpeek/markdown_cv).


The only two files that are required to run the RMarkdown is `cv-template.Rmd` and `cv-template.tex`, which should be stored in the same directory.
